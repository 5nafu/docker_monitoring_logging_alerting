So I am currently setting up a Grafana Dashboard for a Docker-host using cAdvisor, Grafana and Prometheus.

Since I couldn't find any proper documentation of the exposed metrics, I decided to just take the info from the /metrics entpoints and bring it into a human-readable format.

Here you go, maybe I can save someone a couple of minutes.
